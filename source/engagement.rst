Engagement Overview
###################

Congratulations on your purchase of Private Chef! This document serves as your
guide to working with Opscode to install a fully functioning and supported
Private Chef environment.

Each Private Chef installation is a little different. In order to accommodate
this reality, each installation is coordinated and performed by our Consulting
group.

This document covers:

1. Familiarizing you with how to work with Opscode Consulting.
2. The pre-installation process, detailing all of the things youâ€™ll need to have prepared before your Consultant comes on site.
3. An overview of the work that will be performed on-site.
4. Details of the criteria by which you and Opscode can be certain the work has been completed.

We look forward to learning about your environment, and working with you to
ensure you have the highest degree of satisfaction with your Private Chef
deployment.
