On-Site Installation
====================

ATTN: Chef 12 is the  new Chef server! Please see the documentation at http://docs.getchef.com/server/. 

ATTN: The documentation for Private Chef has been moved to https://github.com/opscode/chef-docs and is published to http://docs.opscode.com/release/private_chef/index.html. This content is no longer actively maintained.

Once the pre-installation tasks are verified, your Primary Consultant will
arrive on-site to perform the installation (they may be accompanied by the
Secondary Consultant as well.)

Verify account privileges
-------------------------

The first step on-site is to verify that the Consultants have access to the
Private Chef servers, with appropriate levels of access.

Verify prerequisites
---------------------

They will then verify that the prerequisite tasks have been completed
satisfactorily, in particular the required network access and the operating
system configuration.

Installation of Private Chef
----------------------------

Once the consultants have ensured the prerequisites are met, the installation
of Private Chef will begin. The servers will be connected to the Hosted Chef service,
in order to build and configure the services.

Configuration of HA Services
----------------------------

Once the baseline configuration has been applied, the consultants will then
apply the HA configuration to Private Chef.

Validation
----------

At this point Private Chef will be installed and running. The consultants will
then validate that each service is running and the system is fully functional.

Consultants will verify, with the client, at a minimum:

* Accessibility of the Management Console
* User Creation
* Organization Creation
* Client Creation
* Node Creation
* Cookbook Uploading
* Chef Client Run completion
* Search
* Backup Snapshot creation
* High Availability

Administrative Training
-----------------------

After having validated that Private Chef is functioning properly, we will walk
your designated staff through administering Private Chef. At a minimum, we will
cover:

* Log location
* Service start/stop/restart
* Basic troubleshooting
* Cluster failover

Walkthrough of the Support Process
----------------------------------

Opscode provides 24/7/365 support for Private Chef. As part of the engagement,
we will ensure that you understand how to get in touch with support for both
critical and non-critical issues.
